***Master's thesis: Evaluating Low-Speed Zones in Paris: A Quasi-Experimental Approach to the Zones 30***

This is a repo gathering all the relevant code and data for the replication of the empirical analysis in my master's thesis.

It is fully written in Python (geospatial analysis) and R (statistical and econometric analysis). Each file is devoted to a single process, and code is self-contained and user-friendly. As some of the data used in the analysis are protected under privacy agreements, only the cleaned data derived from open sources will be shared in this repository.
